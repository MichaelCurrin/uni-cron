> Easy scheduler to run tasks exactly once per day and retry at intervals if a task fails

- :racehorse: Efficient scheduling - avoid running tasks too often
- :dromedary_camel: Reliable scheduling - avoid missing tasks on a day
- :dog: Easy task configuration
- :mouse: Logging which is informative but so noisy that is hides errors
- :snail: No external dependencies
