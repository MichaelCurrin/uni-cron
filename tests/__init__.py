"""
Tests initialization module.

This file is required for pytest to correctly do imports.

Make sure TEST=true is set when running tests. That will ensure that main app
var file references are in the test var directory, to keep the main one clean.

You may have to run reset.sh before test. Note that this will delete all test
logs.
